Strengths:
What do you do well?
What unique resources can you draw on?
What do others see as your strengths?

* I have the dedication and discipline needed to become proficient at coding. I am hungry for knowledge, and actually enjoy constantly learning.

* Coming from a physically demanding blue collar background, I understand how software can come into play from an outside perspective. 

* Others often see me as an intelligent person with solid communication skills.

Weaknesses:
What could you improve?
Where do you have fewer resources than others?
What are others likely to see as weaknesses?

* I should try being more outgoing and build working relationships with others.

* I grew up in a poor family and as a result I feel that I didn't have the opportunity to unlock my full potential. For example I was accepted into college after high school, but had no money. I was so scared of student loans that I opted out entirely. 

* I hold myself to a high standard and I am hard on myself |when I fail to live up to those expectations, my friends tell me to not stress so much if my work isn't perfect.

Opportunities:
What opportunities are open to you?
What trends could you take advantage of?
How can you turn your strengths into opportunities?

* The tech industry, and specifically software, is booming currently. 

* Unemployment is reaching record lows, meaning employers should be having a hard time filling roles which works in my favor.

* By polishing my already decent oratory skills, building the skill-set and resume of a marketable junior developer, and good old fashioned hard work I am confident I can get a job in the field.

Threats:

* I do have fears that my lack of a bachelor's degree will blacklist me from many jobs.

* I am introverted and generally avoid interacting with others. This is problematic for obvious reasons.

* I need to force myself to be more social and start 'networking'.
    Without that my chances drop significantly.

As a footnote, I got the Turbulent Architect (INTJ-T) on the 16personalities quiz.
